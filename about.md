Hi! My name is Max Riesberg. I am a recent Computer Science graduate from University of Northern Iowa. My passion in this field is to build practical, creative solutions in software and system security. I enjoy taking on projects that allow me to challenge myself and build my skills.

Throughout my studies at UNI, I worked on several projects ranging from AWS Database Services research to virtual machine administration to network security. These experiences have given me a strong foundation in software engineering, system security, and system administration. 

Right now, I am focused on expanding my technical expertise through hands-on projects including building this website! My goal is to build a career in software engineering where I can apply my skills to solve real-world problems and create impactful technology.
